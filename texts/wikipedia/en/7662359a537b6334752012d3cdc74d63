According to this catalog, an egg of a black american swift cost $75, only the eggs of three birds were more expensive: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), the white-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) [30]. In 1919, the nests were first found deep in the continent, on the territory of the Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada[27][34], but the park employee who found them kept silent about the find. The information was first published by Arthur Cleveland Bent in Life Histories of North American Cuckoos, Goatsuckers, Hummingbirds , and Their Allies ‚Äù(1940), who received a letter from a park employee describing the nest. Since the excitement around the search for eggs had subsided by that time, it was not until 1965 that nests were discovered again in Banff. Various specialists continued to monitor the colony, the number of nests in which it decreased from 5-12 in 1975-1993 to one nest in 2004 [34].
