In addition to a detailed description, he added in his
diary: â€œFor the first time it was possible to observe such a number of these birds flying near our camp; they mostly stayed near the edge of the forest and so high that they were almost on the border of the shooting range "(eng. "A number of these birds were observed, for the first time, this evening flying neat our camp; keeping the most part near the edge of the forest, and so high as to be nearly out of reach of small shot") [12]. Rathbun noted that for several days in early June, birds gather in large flocks. Standing on the ferry, he noticed that they fly very low above the water and can be observed from above from a height of 6 m, while they never touch the water, unlike swallows. At this time, it was raining lightly over the lake [8].
