As soon as the shutter enters its extreme forward position, the trigger hits the receiver and pushes the drummer forward, pricking the primer. When the powder charge is burned, gases are formed that put pressure on the bullet and on the bottom of the sleeve, transferring momentum to the shutter through its cylindrical part. The shutter, shifting back, presses on the liner, as a result of which it slides with its protrusions inside the inclined grooves of the receiver and rises up the side grooves of the shutter. The liner received additional acceleration relative to the shutter when the moving parts moved back, and the cocking mechanism also received acceleration relative to the shutter and slowed down its full opening until the pressure in the barrel drops to a safe level. When the side protrusions of the liner reached the horizontal section of the receiver grooves, the bolt moved back and ejected the sleeve from the receiver, then hitting the rubber buffer located inside the return spring guide rod [78].
