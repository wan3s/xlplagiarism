The construction was led by John Henry Patterson. For more than nine months, from March to December, the workers were attacked by two man-eating lions. The workers, trying to protect themselves from the lions, built fences of thorny bushes (boma) around the tents, but they did not help. Because of the attacks hundreds of workers left Tsavo, and construction was suspended. On December 9, 1898, Patterson managed to shoot the first lion.
