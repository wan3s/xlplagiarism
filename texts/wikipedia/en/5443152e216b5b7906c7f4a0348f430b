The plumage of the chicks is mostly black, but the tips of the feathers are white. The exception is the two outer flight feathers, some feathers under the wing, on the back of the head, on the throat, in the upper chest and on the sides of the neck. These feathers are completely black. Soon the white tips disappear for the most part plumage, but in some places, in particular in the lower abdomen, white tips can persist for three years or longer [20]. Parents feed the chicks once or twice a day, usually at sunset or early in the morning, each parent brings prey [ 2][17].
