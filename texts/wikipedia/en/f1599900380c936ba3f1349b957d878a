Islands of aquatic vegetation, called sedds, break away from the muddy ground in high water and slowly float downstream. Colliding and merging with each other, they often clog the channel and interfere with navigation. When crossing the Sedd area, up to 2/3 of the water is lost to evaporation, food aquatic vegetation and filling depressions [4]. The largest tributaries in this part of the stream, having sources in the west of Ethiopia, are El Ghazal (“the river of gazelles”) and Sobat [9], whose waters, flowing down from the mountains, contain a large amount of suspension and have a characteristic dull yellow (whitish) color. Below the Sobata, the river is called the White Nile (Bahr el-Abyad), leaves behind the swamp area and then flows calmly in a wide valley through a semi-desert area to Khartoum, where it merges with the Blue Nile.
