the amount of precipitation ranges from 600 to 1800 mm. The absolute maximum annual precipitation is 4100 mm in the region of Meskhetia and Adjara. The level of precipitation in the Lesser Caucasus (southern Georgia, Armenia, western Azerbaijan), not including Meskhetia, varies from 300 to 800 mm per year. The Caucasus is known for a large amount of snowfall, although the slopes on the windward side receive much less snow. This is especially noticeable in the Lesser Caucasus, which is somewhat isolated from the influence of humidity coming from the Black Sea, and receives much less precipitation (including in the form of snow) than in the mountains of the Greater Caucasus.
