Eggs of the black american swift were bought by egg collector John E. Thayler, who was ready to pay large sums for new finds. It is known that he sent a ship with a team and a naturalist to Wrangel Island for shovel eggs (Calidris pygmaea). In 1922 R. Magoon Barnes published The American Oologist's Exchange Price List of North American Bird's Eggs.
