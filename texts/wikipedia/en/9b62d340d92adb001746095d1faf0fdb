According to Marin, the birds immediately start migrating, otherwise they would have to return to the nest, since they do not have many suitable places to spend the night[20]. However, rare cases of returns have been noted, usually associated with the coincidence of departure from the nest and storm[27]. Presumably, birds are capable of breeding from one year[18]. Survival and life expectancy
The use of the same nests of the Black Swift yearly has led scientists to suggest that the species has a high survival rate, higher than that of passerines of similar size [29]. According to studies of a large colony in Colorado, the success of laying C. n. borealis accounts for 72% [27].
