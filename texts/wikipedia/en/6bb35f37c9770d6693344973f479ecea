While other examples of similar rapid-fire weapons with the same goals already existed, it was the Thompson that was the first to receive the official classification as a “submachine gun” (English submachine gun, literally “submachine gun”, “a lighter version of the machine gun” a similar term is now present in American English)[23][18]. Thompson believed that his weapon could be used as an automatic "trench broom", which "sweep" the enemy out of the trenches, and do it much better than the automatic rifle BAR[32 ]. The same idea was supported by the engineers of the German Empire, led by Theodor Bergmann, who developed the MP-18 submachine gun used by the Germans in infiltration tactics [33]. The Thompson went on mass sale under the name M1921 (manufactured by Colt), having received the usual design: a barrel with transverse cooling ribs at the base, a front pistol grip, a removable wooden butt and a sector sight with a full diopter, calculated for shooting up to about 550 m. On the civilian market, just such an option was offered with box magazines for 20 and 30 rounds and drum magazines for 50 and 100 rounds. However, it cost from $ 200, which at that time was a lot of money and did not contribute to sales - the cost of the Tommy Gun in modern money was about $ 2,800, and the Ford Model A passenger car was at least twice as expensive as the Thompson.
