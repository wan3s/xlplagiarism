Loitering for the purpose of prostitution is prohibited in all states of the United States. In 1992, Chicago passed an anti-loitering law to make it more difficult for gangs to commit crimes and drug dealing. the right to disperse such people, and in case of disobedience, established a punishment in the form of prison or community service. It was later overturned by the US Supreme Court for vagueness, the lack of a clear criterion separating acceptable behavior from unacceptable (en: City of Chicago v. Morales). In 2000 The city adopted an amended version of the law, eliminating items that were contrary to the Constitution.
