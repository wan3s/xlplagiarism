The texts of de Courdel literature can be in verse or prose. There are also farces, stories, fantastic tales and writings with moral overtones. Initially, this literature was considered colonial. European themes were orally reflected in it: first of all, the theme of courage and conquest[11]. Later literature was influenced by the culture of the indigenous people of Brazil and Africans.
