Perhaps this explains why the tips of their tail feathers are not sharp [16]. Black American swifts lose an average of 7.9% of their mass per night [17]. During the hunt, the birds also do not compete with each other, as during the breeding season and beyond. They gather in large flocks, which often include other swifts and swallows. Perhaps this is due to the fact that birds can rise high into the air in search of food and fly far from the nest[13].
