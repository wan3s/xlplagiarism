In 1927, the US Navy ordered 500 examples with a low rate of fire, and Thompson turned to Payne for help in reducing the rate of fire of weapons. Payne suggested replacing the spring in the bolt with a stiffer one, as well as installing a heavier trigger mechanism. This reduced the rate of fire to 600 rounds per minute - these are the parameters of the Navy Model 1928, M1 and M1A1 models[81]. The rate of fire, combined with a heavy trigger and a large butt, led to instability during continuous firing[81][82], as a result of which, by modern standards, this submachine gun is considered very heavy (equal in weight to the M1 Garand rifle) and requires careful maintenance. This was the most serious claim from the US Army[37].
