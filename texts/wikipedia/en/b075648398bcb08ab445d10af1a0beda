In the north of the delta, there are lagoon lakes Menzala, Burullus, Maryut [4]. The delta was formed on the site of a sea bay, gradually filled with river sediments. In terms of area (24 thousand km²), the Nile Delta is almost equal to the Crimean peninsula. Greek geographers called the mouth of the Nile "Delta" , who compared its triangular shape with the letter Δ of the Greek alphabet, thus giving the name to all the river deltas of the globe.
