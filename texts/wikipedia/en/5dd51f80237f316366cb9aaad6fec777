In 1888, information appeared about the discovery of a masonry of a black american swift, but most likely the nest on the eaves of a building in Seattle belonged to a purple forest swallow (Progne subis). One of the ardent critics of both finds was the American ornithologist William Leon Dawson [30]. Vrooman and Dawson were able to discover an egg during a joint trip to the rocks, and the finds were recognized[30][27]. Later, these researchers became friends and made several joint ornithological expeditions. At the same time, Dawson noted that it is unlikely that the rocks on the seashore are the only a suitable place for the nests of the black swift, and most likely these birds build nests high in the mountains.
