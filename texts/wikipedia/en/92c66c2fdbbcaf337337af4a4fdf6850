Previously, it was believed that such an interaction of the H-shaped liner with the bolt was used to slow down the recoil, since at the initial moment of the shot, when there was a lot of powder gas pressure in the barrel, the liner held the bolt in the forward position, and after the pressure dropped in the channel, it went up, breaking the clutch with the shutter and ensuring its self-release. However, later experiments showed that the matter was not in the liner: the shutter is unlocked at high pressure in the chamber, and deceleration occurs with the mutual resistance of the parts that occurs during their movement along inclined surfaces. The liner was necessary for connection with the cocking and bolt so that the weapon could be cocked, and when the liner was installed upside down, the weapon did not work [30]. Later, in the modified modifications of the M1A1 and M1, the liner was absent, although during the initial firing process there were chronic problems with ejection of shells, and the locking knot wore out quickly [78]. A successful scheme slowed down The reduction and low pressure in the chamber developed by pistol ammunition, in general, contributed to the increase in the reliability of the weapon [80].
