In 1910, Ridgway singled out birds from Jamaica and some neighboring islands from the nominative subspecies into a separate subspecies Nephoecetes niger jamaicensis, and birds from Costa Rica from Nephoecetes niger borealis into the subspecies Nephoecetes niger costaricensis [37]. Allan Keith (English Allan Keith) believes that the black American swift from the Antilles is a separate species,
          
which may have already become extinct on the mainland[19]. In 1956, the British ornithologist David Lack simplified the classification of swifts and returned the black American swift to the genus Cypseloides[12][38], which is the name used since the fifth edition of the reference book[12]. Currently, scientists believe that the American black swift is closely related to the white-breasted American swift (Cypseloides lemosi), the Rothschild's swift (Cypseloides rothschildi) and the dark American swift (Cypseloides fumigatus)[2][39].
