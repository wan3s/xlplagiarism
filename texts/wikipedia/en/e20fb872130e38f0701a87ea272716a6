As a result, the British sent huge quantities of submachine guns back to the United States in exchange for magazines for them. A more convenient box magazine for 20 rounds was light, small, did not make unpleasant sounds and did not restrict movement [63]. It was convenient to insert it into the receiver window with the shutter closed and pulled out - thus it was easier and faster to reload the weapon in the event of a misfire, and it was easier to fill an empty magazine with additional cartridges. However, since the magazine's capacity was small, the fighters often took two magazines that could be glued with tape - this is how the “double magazine (English) Russian” appeared, which made it possible to reload weapons faster and conduct continuous fire [64]. On December 6, 1941, two additional options were tested at Fort Knox at the shooting range - an extended magazine for 30 rounds and two combined magazines for 20 cartridges (the latter was also used when testing the UD M42 submachine gun).
