Liberal feminists argue that society has a false belief that women are inherently less intellectually and physically capable than men. Thus, society discriminates against women in science, the labor market, and public discussion platforms. Liberal feminists believe that “women's subordination is caused by a set of educational and legal restrictions that make it very difficult for women to achieve success.” Liberal feminists strive for gender equality through their political and legal program.[1].
