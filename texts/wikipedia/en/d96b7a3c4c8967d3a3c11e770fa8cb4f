The birds have a strong body and long wide wings, a tail with a shallow but clearly visible cut. The plumage is black, the head is noticeably lighter, in the lower part the tips of the feathers are often painted white. Black American swifts hunt flying insects, while gathering in large flocks and can fly several kilometers from nesting colonies. Birds fly so high that they are often not visible from the ground. Traditionally, nests are built in the same wet and inaccessible places, often on rocks high in the mountains, near waterfalls.
