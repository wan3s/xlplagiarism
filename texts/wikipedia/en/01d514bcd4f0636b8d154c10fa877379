The subspecies Cypseloides niger costaricensis is located between them. Thus, the size of birds increases from south to north [10], which may be due both to the specialization of subspecies and to Bergman's rule [11]. The American ornithologist Robert Ridgway in his 1911 work gives the following dimensions C. n. borealis: wing length of an adult male, 157.5–175 mm; female, 156–164 mm; male tail length 53–66 mm, female 47–58.5 mm. Wing length C. n. niger, according to Eugene Eisenman and Federico Carlos Lehman in 1962, is 148–158 mm in males and 142–154 mm in females. The wing length of C. n. costaricensis according to Marin and Stiles 1992 is 159.15 mm, the tail is 53.55 mm [3].
