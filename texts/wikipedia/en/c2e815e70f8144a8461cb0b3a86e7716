Global warming can lead to the melting of glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, which means high water levels in late summer and autumn, due to which the nests of the black american swift can be flooded [22]. Due to the high speed of flight, adult black american swifts have practically no natural enemies. Only single attacks of peregrine falcons and merlins in flight were noted. Nests are usually located in hard-to-reach places, and chicks are well protected by dark plumage, however, scientists occasionally found remains of shells and feathers, which may be the result of an attack by predatory animals. In addition, some colonies located in easily accessible tourist spots in California, Colorado, and Idaho have been vandalized by people[13].
