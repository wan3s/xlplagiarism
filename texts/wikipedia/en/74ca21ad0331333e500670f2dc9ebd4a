In 1994, in the winter, birds were noted in Colombia [20]. Birds leave Colorado on September 10-19 and already on September 28-October 12 they arrive at winter quarters. The return journey takes place from May 9-20 to May 23-June 18. The geolocation surveys by which these data were obtained showed that the birds spent most of the winter in the state of Amazonas in Brazil, in northern Bolivia, in eastern Peru and in southern Colombia [11].
