Black American swifts can forage more than other swifts in the region[13]. On the other hand, based on the absence of flocks of small and very dark representatives of the subfamily, Marin and Styles concluded that birds feed singly, in pairs or in small groups, or join large flocks of swifts on the border of storm fronts[24]. During the hunt, birds do not fly in circles, but in arcs, while the completion of the maneuver is often accompanied by rapid flapping of wings, but if the birds remain motionless, which sometimes happens, then they make a small fall [8]. In British Columbia, adult birds feed chicks mainly on flying ants, to the abundance of which American black swifts predict the appearance of chicks [2], similar results were shown in studies in California and Mexico [23].
