The nature of the Nile is stormy, calm in the lower reaches. The largest river flowing into Lake Victoria is the Kagera, formed by the confluence of the Nyavarongo and Ruvuvu rivers. It flows through the territories of the countries of Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, in some places along the borders between them. The length of the Kagera proper is from the confluence of the sources before flowing into Lake Victoria is about 420 km, and if we count from the most distant point of its hydrographic system - the source of the Rukarara River, then about 800 km. The riverbed passes through a wide marshy valley, receiving the waters of numerous small lakes[10]

The section from the northern tip of Lake Victoria to its confluence with Lake Albert (Uganda, East Africa) is called the Victoria Nile.
