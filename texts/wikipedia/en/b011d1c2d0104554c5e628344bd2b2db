Since August 7, 2018, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the American black swift as a vulnerable species, before that it was classified as a species of least concern[4]. The bird is protected at the national level in the United States, as well as in all the western states of the country[22]. Scientists attribute the decline in the number of black american swifts to a small number of places suitable for nesting. Many of these places are already occupied by adult pairs that continue to return to their nests year after year. In addition, the amount of available food plays a big role[18].
