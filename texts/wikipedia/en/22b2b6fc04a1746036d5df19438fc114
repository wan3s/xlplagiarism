On the Pacific side of Mexico, birds live in the region from Chihuahua to Oaxaca, and on the Atlantic side, from Hidalgo to the north of Oaxaca. In Central America, birds live in the territory from Costa Rica to Guatemala and Honduras, and are found on many islands of the West Indies [3]. Black american swifts prefer open mountain
landscapes in continental North America and forested mountains in the West Indies, sometimes they can be found above the plains. Outside the tropical regions, black swifts live in the border areas between mountain evergreen forests and secondary forests [2] [11]. As early as 1925 Rathbun suggested that they nested high in the mountains and descended every morning to the plains, where they spent their day[8].
