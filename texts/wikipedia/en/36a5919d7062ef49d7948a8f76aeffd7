The US Postal Inspection Service and the US Marine Corps (before the invasion of Nicaragua in 1927)[19] were the first to purchase these weapons in small quantities[34], with postmen using them to protect themselves from robbers[35]; similarly, the Marines used these weapons to guard ships belonging to the Postal Inspection Service [36]. Later, purchases of weapons by the police of several states and the US Coast Guard [19] [36] followed, and the export of weapons to Central and South America also began [35]. The US Marines used this weapon in the Banana Wars and during the Chinese Civil War. In particular, this weapon was ideal for point defense and against ambushes by Nicaraguan guerrillas. A squad of four armed with Thompson submachine guns, was as effective as a squad of nine soldiers with rifles.
