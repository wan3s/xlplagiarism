In British Columbia, nests are often found on rock ledges near waterfalls under overhanging moss[2]. In Colorado and New Mexico, temperatures at nesting sites averaged 9.4°C and humidity 89.7% throughout the breeding season. Similar studies in California showed 13.4 °C and 92.8%, respectively [27]. At the same time, temperature differences in caves are very small, which ensures
                        
 stable temperature conditions and high humidity[20]. Nests are located in close proximity to water, often under spray from waterfalls[27].
