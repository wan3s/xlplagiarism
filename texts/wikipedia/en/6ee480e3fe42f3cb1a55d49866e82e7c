Domestic avocado consumption for 2010-11 was projected at 806,000 tons, up 8.45 percent from the previous year.[12]

Mexican avocado production is concentrated in the state of Michoac√°n in west-central Mexico. Michiocan accounts for 92% of the country's production of this crop, the region leads the world in avocado production, with avocado plantations occupying about 106,000 hectares there.[12] The avocado yield in Michiocan is 4 tons per hectare and can reach 8 tons per hectare, which is much higher than in the US state of California.[13]

Favorable conditions for large-scale production in the country are due to the availability of land, cheap labor and the nature of precipitation.
