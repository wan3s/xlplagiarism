Using the same statistics but different multipliers, Rick Levade, author of The Coolest Bird, a non-fiction book on the black swift, estimated the number at 18,750 birds.[21] 94% from 1970 to 2014. According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey in 1994-2015, the number is declining by 5.3% annually [2][4]. Other studies show that the number of this species in Canada decreased by 9, 1% per year in 1966-1995, while in the United States it increased by 24.3% per year in 1980-1995[3][2]. In 1985 and 1986, the number of adult birds in southern California was estimated at 28 and 26 individuals, respectively [2].
