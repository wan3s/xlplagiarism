During a thunderstorm, large induced charges appear on the Earth, and a strong electric field arises near the Earth's surface. The field strength is especially high near sharp conductors, and therefore a corona discharge ignites at the end of the lightning rod. The air near the lightning rod is strongly ionized as a result of a corona discharge. As a result, the electric field near the tip decreases (as well as inside any conductor)[1], induced charges cannot accumulate on the building and the probability of lightning occurrence is reduced. In the same cases when lightning does occur (such cases are very rare), lightning comes from the lightning rod causing no damage[2].
