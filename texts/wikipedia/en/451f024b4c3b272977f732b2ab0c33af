The Greater Caucasus stretches for more than 1,100 km from northwest to southeast, from the region of Anapa and the Taman Peninsula of the Black Sea to the Absheron Peninsula on the Caspian coast, near Baku. The Greater Caucasus reaches its maximum width in the region of the Elbrus meridian (almost 180 km) .In the axial part there is the Main Caucasian (or Dividing) Range, to the north of which a number of parallel ridges (mountain ranges) extend, including a monoclinal (kuest) character (see Greater Caucasus). The southern slope of the Greater Caucasus mostly consists of echelon-shaped ridges adjacent to the Main Caucasian Range.
