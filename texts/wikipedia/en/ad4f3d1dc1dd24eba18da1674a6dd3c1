Often correct identification is possible only for caught birds[5]. In the air
The behavior of black american swifts in the air was described in
1925 by Samuel Rathbun, who watched them in the area
Puget Bay and Lake Washington[8]. According to the scientist,
the number of birds over the lake was so great that even
rough estimates were impossible. Birds flew to
the whole route of the ferry (about four hours) so far,
as soon as you can see[8]. On the same lake, Caleb Burwell
Rowan Kennerley in the 1850s first saw and described C. n.
borealis.
