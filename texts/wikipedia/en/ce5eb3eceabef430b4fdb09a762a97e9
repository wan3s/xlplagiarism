Its length is about 420 km. Crossing the rocky ridges across the territory of Uganda, the river forms numerous rapids and waterfalls with a total fall of 670 m. The largest Murchison waterfall reaches 40 m in height. The river passes through the depression of Lake Kyoga and flows into Lake Albert on the border of Uganda and Republic of the Congo, lying in a tectonic depression at an altitude of 617 m. in a vast flat basin [4]. Waterlogging occurs due to the fact that huge masses of algae and papyrus clutter up the channel, the channel breaks up into a number of branches, the flow rate drops, and most of the water brought from the mountains spills over the surface, evaporates, and is consumed by aquatic vegetation .
