The sound signals of birds on the nest make it difficult to hear the constant sound of water [15]. It is possible that the black american swift is capable of echolocation. This assumption was made based on the constant noise that birds make when returning to the nest in complete darkness. However, it was not found no ultrasonic noise in caves with large colonies of black swift[15]. Territorial behavior
Birds return to their caves and even to their nests every year, but they do not show territorial behavior.
