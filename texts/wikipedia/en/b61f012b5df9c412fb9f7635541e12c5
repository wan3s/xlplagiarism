In 1970-1974, several specimens of black American swifts were obtained on a farm in Costa Rica, and in 1980-1987, research on swifts 15 km from the country's capital on the Tiribi River was carried out by Marin and Stiles , but they also found no nests. In 1997, Marin found three nests of black swifts in Costa Rica [19].
