Equal Rights Amendment[edit | edit code]
Three years after women won the right to vote, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the US Constitution was introduced in Congress by Senator Curtis and Representative Anthony. This amendment stated that civil rights could not be absent on the basis of gender. The author of this amendment is Alice Paul, the head of the "National Woman's Party", which led the election campaign. Thanks to the efforts of Alice Paul, the amendment was introduced to all meetings of the United States Congress, but both houses of the US Congress did not move forward and hushed up the case with an amendment to the Constitution.
