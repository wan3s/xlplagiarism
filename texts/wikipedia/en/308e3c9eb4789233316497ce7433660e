Kevin S. Foerster observed the fall of a pair of birds mated together for 3-4 seconds and possibly mating [13]. However, Marin and Stiles believe that copulation in the air increases the chance of egg sterility, which is disadvantageous for birds with such clutch size[28], while this species has a very high probability of clutch success[2]. Marin suggested that such collisions in the air may be explained by aggression, since Tachycineta thalassina may be involved in them[17]. Nests
