The lions were stuffed into stuffed animals, which are still exhibited in the museum. Patterson reported different information about the number of victims. In a 1907 book, he wrote that lions killed twenty-eight Indian workers, and the number of Africans killed is unknown. In a brochure written in 1925 for the Field Museum, he gave a different number of those killed - one hundred and thirty-five [1]. In 2007, a representative of the National Museum of Kenya said that the remains of lions should be returned to Kenya, since this is an important part of Kenyan history [2].
