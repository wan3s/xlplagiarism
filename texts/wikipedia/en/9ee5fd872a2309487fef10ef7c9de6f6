William Leon Dawson, when he first saw the egg of the black american swift in 1914, noted that it was three times the size of the egg of the white-bellied rough-footed swift (Aeronautes saxatalis) [30]. The incubation period lasts 23-27 days [2] [20], in C .n. borealis - 22-32 days [27]. Both the male and the female are engaged in incubation, while the female usually spends a little more time on the nest than the male. Parents never leave the egg open [20]. Black American swifts make only one clutch and do not re-lay eggs when the clutch is lost[2][20], a rare quality in birds, also shared by some birds of prey and seabirds.
