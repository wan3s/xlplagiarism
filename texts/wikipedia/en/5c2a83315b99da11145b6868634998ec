Due to their mobility, the thureophores could fight like archers and, if necessary, reorganize into a phalanx [1]. This ability made the thureophores very effective in defending border areas. As a result, these innovative troops for their time replaced the peltasts, but, in turn, obsolete after the success of the Roman manipulative system. In the 4th century BC, the peltasts were considered the main type of mercenary infantry, to the point that they became synonymous with mercenaries.
