In Costa Rica, birds most likely nest on the Cordillera Central and Cordillera de Talamanca, but nests have not yet been discovered[26]. Mating behavior
It is still unknown at what point in time the black american swifts form a pair [27]. According to Rathbun's observations, at the time when large flocks break into groups, the breeding season has already begun. then suddenly fly up to each other and make a joint fall at a very high speed almost to the ground. This behavior is typical for birds in late June and early July, but can last longer[8].
