Researchers repeatedly caught black swifts on the same nest or in the same nesting colony in three to five years. Most often, at the first capture, the birds were already adults. On July 20, 1994, a bird was caught that was ringed at an adult age of 20 August 1985, so her age was at least 10 years and 1 month[29]. The bird is known to be 15 years and 1 month old[18]. In 1983, a dead bird was found in Colorado, at least 6 years and 10 months old at the time of death[29].
