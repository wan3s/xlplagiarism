On the northern slope of the Greater Caucasus Range, it is 3 degrees Celsius colder than on the southern slopes. In the high mountainous regions of the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, a sharp temperature contrast between summer and winter is noted due to a more continental climate. Precipitation increases from east to west in most areas. Altitude also plays an important role: the mountains usually receive more precipitation than the lowlands. The northeastern regions (Dagestan) and the southern part of the Lesser Caucasus are dry.
