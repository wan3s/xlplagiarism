So, the Republic of China acquired part of the Thompsons to fight against the Japanese army, and later began to produce copies for its troops (in China, production was established in the 1930s by the Arsenal Taiyuan (English) Russian company for the needs of the troops of General Yan Xishan). In 1933, the weapon was used during the Chaco War and proved to be excellent in combat in a confined space - 13 soldiers of the armed forces of Paraguay, armed with Thompsons, during the defense of the fort held back a detachment of more than 100 fighters for several minutes, killing 38 opponents (including including 21 in the premises of the fort) and losing one killed and three wounded. In 1924, the M1921 Thompson party came to the USSR through Mexico and was adopted as “Thompson light machine guns” by the OGPU and border troops, who used weapons to eliminate bands of Basmachi .In the UK, the submachine gun was manufactured by the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) under the name BSA 1926 and differed in a different set of calibers (including under 7.62 × 25 mm), however, production ceased due to an unsuccessful experiment by engineers - they decided to remove the fire control handle and move the trigger guard to the rear wall of the receiver, and also add a stock copied from the stock of a Lee-Enfield rifle, but because of this, the weapon became larger and heavier, and its balance deteriorated significantly [19]. The Thompson submachine gun gained its fame (mostly notorious) during the Prohibition era in the United States and during the Great Depression, as it became the favorite weapon of gangsters, who highly appreciated its huge rate of fire and power [19].
