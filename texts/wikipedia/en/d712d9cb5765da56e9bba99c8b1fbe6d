On June 17, 2019, Nicolas Maure, former president of the company, was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[46] Sergey Skvortsov, who previously held this position, took over as deputy chairman of the board of directors. The export name of the car was chosen by Lada, while in the domestic market the car was sold as Zhiguli (after the name of the mountains). The first Lada cars (VAZ-2101) were exported from 1971. Among the countries that imported Lada, there were countries from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (these deliveries partially covered the cost of certain types of components for the plant), and those who bought cars for hard currency.
