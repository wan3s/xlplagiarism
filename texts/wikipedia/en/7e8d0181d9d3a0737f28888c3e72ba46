The Lesser Caucasus is connected to the Greater Caucasus by the Likhi Ridge, in the west it is separated from it by the Colchis Lowland, in the east by the Kura Depression. The length is about 600 km, the height is up to 4090 m.

The Caucasus are folded mountains with some volcanic activity, which formed (like the Himalayas) during the era of Alpine folding (about 28-23 million years ago). The mountains consist, among other things, of granite and gneiss, the foothills contain deposits of oil and natural gas. Estimated reserves: up to 200 billion barrels of oil (for comparison: in Saudi Arabia, according to an estimate of 260 billion barrels [source not specified 936 days]). From a geophysical point of view, the Caucasus forms a wide deformation zone, which is part of the continental plate collision belt from the Alps to the Himalayas.
