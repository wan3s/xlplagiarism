Although the drum magazine provided tremendous firepower, it was too heavy and uncomfortable for the soldiers, especially when the weapon was held on the shoulder during the march[82]. The magazine for the M1928A1 was very fragile, and the cartridges inside it rattled, creating unnecessary noise. For these reasons magazines for 20 and 30 rounds were the most popular among soldiers, and when developing the M1 and M1A1, the possibility of installing drum magazines was excluded. The Thompson was one of the first submachine guns whose box magazines were double-row, and thus added reliability to the weapon .Thanks to further improvements, the submachine gun became more resistant to rainwater, dirt and dust[37].
