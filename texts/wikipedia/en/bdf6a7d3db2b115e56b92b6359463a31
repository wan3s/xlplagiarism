The grooves are beveled at the same angle and rise to the level of the cylindrical part of the bolt, after which they go horizontally. The parallelepiped is completely open in the upper part, there is a cocking mechanism inside it, on its upper wall there is a spherical handle with a longitudinal slot for aiming, on the lower there is a fork ledge , inside which the liner jumper enters. When the cocking lever is pulled, the liner rises in the grooves of the receiver, displacing the bolt, and then stops, after which the moving parts reach the cocked position [78] [79]. After pressing the trigger, the spring pushes the cocking rod forward, and that, through the kinematic connection provided by the H-shaped liner, moves the bolt forward. The cylindrical part of the bolt picks up the upper cartridge from the magazine and places it in the chamber, and the cocker, pushing the liner, shifts it down the inclined grooves of the receiver.
