In labor protection, there is a ban on being in places not related to production needs during working hours, which can be described as a ban on loitering. Loitering is close to parasitism and begging. The history of the ban
Loitering has been banned by local governments in many countries, especially in Great Britain. The most common prohibition is in some states and jurisdictions in the US and Australia. The history of anti-loitering laws can be traced back to 15th-century English common law.
