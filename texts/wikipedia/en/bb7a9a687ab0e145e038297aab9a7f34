Agents Frank Smith and F. Joseph Lackey, as well as Special Agent R. E. Vetterli, survived the massacre, who reported that there were three or four attackers [54]. After the incident, the FBI acquired a large batch of submachine guns to fight against the gangsters [ 40]. On November 27, 1934, gangster Baby Nelson (Lester Joseph Gillies) started a shootout in Barrington (Eng) Russian (a town near Chicago) against the FBI, during which he killed two federal agents Herman "Ed" Hollis (English) Russian [55 ] and Samuel Parkinson Cowley (English) Russian [56] [57], but he himself was killed, having received 17 wounds from bullets .45 ACP [58]. In 1938, the Thompson submachine gun was adopted by the American troops and went through World War II. During the war years, two of its most famous variants appeared:

M1928A1 - compatible with both box and drum magazines; had a Cutts compensator and cooling fins on the barrel; principle of operation - free shutter with a delay; design features - a bolt handle on the top of the receiver, a complex frame sight, a wooden forearm instead of the front pistol grip.
