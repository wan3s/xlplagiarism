Systematics
                  The taxonomic position of the black american swift was repeatedly revised. Baird considered that Cypselus borealis is not quite similar to the American swifts and singled it out and Hirundo nigra, which by that time had changed its name to Cypselus niger, into a separate genus Nephoecetes[12][37]. At the same time, , he noted that their description is similar and may refer to the same species [12]. In 1865, the British zoologist Philip Sclater renamed the genus Cypselus to Cypseloides and combined both swifts under the name Cypseloides niger. This name was retained in the first (1895) and second ( 1910) editions of the Checklist of North American Birds[12], but the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway identified the species as a separate monotypic genus and used the name Nephoecetes niger[37], under which the species is included in the third (1917) and fourth (1931) editions " Checklist of North American Birds"[12].
