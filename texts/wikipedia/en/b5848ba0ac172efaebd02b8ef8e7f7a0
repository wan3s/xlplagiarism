Instead of the abbreviation "VAZ", cars, including models that have been produced for more than one decade, received the single name Lada, which was previously used only as a trademark for export options. Meanwhile, the then head of AvtoVAZ, Vladimir Kadannikov, said that the most accurate the names of its products are given by the people - “penny” and “chisel” will not be eradicated by any Latin alphabet[99]. in 2008, sellers and buyers still use the old model names - “twelfth”, “thirteenth”, etc. [100]. Use of jargon
Since the mid-1990s, in relation to cars manufactured by the enterprise, the jargon "TAZ" or "Tazik" began to be used, the origin of which is obvious by analogy with the abbreviations of other Soviet automobile plants ("GAZ", "UAZ"), named after the place where they are located - Togliatti Automobile Plant.
