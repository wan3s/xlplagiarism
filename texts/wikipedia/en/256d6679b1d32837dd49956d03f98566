[11] The full name from June 2019 is Joint Stock Company AVTOVAZ[12], before that it was Public Joint Stock Company AVTOVAZ[13]. .Every year the number of cars produced grew, the fleet of private cars grew. In the USSR, the purchase of cars by private individuals became possible back in the early 1950s, but then the choice was small: between the relatively cheap Moskvich and the expensive Pobeda (later Volga "). In addition, the number of Moskvich cars produced was insufficient to cover demand, and therefore motorcycles and scooters remained the most affordable personal transport for a long time.
