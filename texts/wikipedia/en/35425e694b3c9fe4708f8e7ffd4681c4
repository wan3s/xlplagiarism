The birds showed not very fast flight, which consisted of alternating short gaps of gliding and quick turns in the air. With a few flaps of the wings, the birds quickly rose up and then fell below the initial level[8][13]. Some groups of birds rose to a height of 60 -90 m, circled there, and then returned back [8]. Rathbun noted that while gliding through the air, the black American swift always keeps its wings below the horizontal level [8]. It demonstrates a very maneuverable flight, often changing direction, accelerating or decelerating [fourteen].
