Thompson planned to reconfigure the weapon for an intermediate cartridge, since the unlocking slowdown was present in the system as a reserve in case of switching to a powerful ammunition. However, it was not possible to test the weapon with any type of ammunition, because even before the first batch of prototypes was sent to Europe, the First World War ended. According to some reports, only on November 11, 1918, on the day of the signing of the Compi√®gne armistice, which became the day the war ended, the first batch of weapons arrived in New York, which was planned to be sent to Europe for testing at the front[29][30]. In 1919 at a meeting of the Auto-Ordnance board of directors, the prospects for the Exterminator's distribution to the market after the end of the war were discussed. The weapon was renamed the "Thompson submachine gun".
