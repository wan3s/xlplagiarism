From 15 days to 3 months of arrest is due for loitering. The only paragraph of the same article indicates that “acquisition by the convict of a sufficient livelihood exempts him from the execution of punishment.” In this article, loitering is formulated quite broadly, so that even an unofficially employed person or an unlicensed seller could be arrested. This gave the police a reason to detain any suspicious person (for example, blacks, temporarily unemployed, capoeiristas and just people without documents). In 1975, loitering was the second most common crime recorded in Rio de Janeiro [ 3].
