It turned out that the Blish bolt would be better used as a friction delayed free bolt. Thompson eventually revised the concept of his work, deciding to convert it into a “light machine gun for one person”, which could be effectively used in trench warfare on the fronts of the First World War war. Payne finalized the appearance of the weapon by creating box and drum magazines. The new project was called the "Destroyer I" (English Annihilator I), and most of the design solutions were found by 1918 - he already used a more practical magazine feed and an improved shutter [ 12]. The sight was as simple as possible, because, according to Thompson's calculations, it would be better to fire from such a weapon from the hip [21].
