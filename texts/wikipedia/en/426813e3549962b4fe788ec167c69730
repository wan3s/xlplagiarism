This regular fertilization plays a huge role in Egypt's agriculture. The creation of the Aswan Hydro Complex contributed to the long-term regulation of the flow of the Nile, eliminated the threat of catastrophic floods (previously, during high water, the water level in the river near Cairo rose to 8 m) and made it possible to increase the total area of ​​irrigated land. It should be recognized that however, that the construction of the Aswan High Dam and hydroelectric power plant, completed in 1970, putting an end to spring floods, simultaneously deprived Egypt's agriculture of the most important natural fertilizer - silt. But control over the flow of water has created conditions for year-round irrigation, and now in some areas even three crops a year. On the Nile are the large cities of Khartoum, Aswan, Luxor (Thebes), the urban agglomeration of Cairo-Giza; in the delta - Alexandria.
