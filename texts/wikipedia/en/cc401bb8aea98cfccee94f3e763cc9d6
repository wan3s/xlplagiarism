In the 1950s, plantations of the Fuerte variety were established; two decades later, Hass was planted and became the country's leading variety.[5] This variety was born when a postal worker in Southern California, Rudolf Hass, decided to buy a small 1.5-acre grove in La Habra Heights to experiment with growing high-yielding avocado trees. The hybrid he settled on and patented in 1935 was predominantly Guatemalan with some Mexican genes[10]. It produced fruit that was a darker purple hue than was common at the time, but was tastier, less oily, and better preserved. Hass's profit from his patent until it expired in 1960 amounted to 4800 dollars.
