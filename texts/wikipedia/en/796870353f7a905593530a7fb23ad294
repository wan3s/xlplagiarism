At the age of 18-22 days, the weight of the chicks is compared with the weight of adult birds, but it continues to grow until it reaches a maximum on the 33-45th day[20]. The chicks remain in the nest for at least 48 days in California[20] and Colorado[ 27], 45 days in British Columbia, 51-52 days in Guadeloupe[2]. They fly out of the nest at a weight of at least 50 g or 113% of adult birds. Usually this occurs in the morning, most often before eight o'clock[20]. After the chicks have flown out of the nests, neither adults nor young birds return to it until the next year.
