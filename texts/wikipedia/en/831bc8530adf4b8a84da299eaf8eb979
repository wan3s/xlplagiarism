The Achaean League at the time of Philopemen abandoned the thureos around 208-207 BC. e. in favor of the heavy Macedonian phalanx[1][2], although the citizens of Megalopolis, an Achaean city, adopted the Macedonian style only by 222 BC. e., after Antigonus III Doson handed over bronze shields to the townspeople to form an army of epilects (OE Greek ἐπίλεκτοι, "selected"), known as chalkaspides (OE Greek Χαλχασπίδες, "bronze shields"). By the end 3rd century BC e. Thureophores were no longer the dominant troop type in the smaller Greek states, giving way to the Macedonian phalanx. A similar troop type with heavier armor is the Thorakites.
