In the fall of 1917, after much work, a sample appeared called the “Forceman” or “Persuader” (English Persuader), developed for the .45 ACP [12] cartridge. Food was supplied not from the magazine, but from the tape; the butt was missing, the fire control handle was shifted forward so that the front of the trigger guard closely adjoined the magazine, and for better controllability an additional handle was located under the barrel [21]. However, by the end of 1917, the limits of using the Blish shutter were found. Due to the frictional force of the bronze liner moving inside its core, it did not ensure full locking of the bore for the duration of the shot, but only slowed down the shutter to the extreme rear position, slowing it down at the time of the shot. This limited the power range of cartridges that could be used in weapons , and the only one that met the requirements was the .45 ACP cartridge used in the M1911 pistols and similar revolvers.
