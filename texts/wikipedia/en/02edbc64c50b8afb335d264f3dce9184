M1 and M1A1 - barrel without cooling fins, simplified permanent sight; only compatible with box magazines; direct free shutter, bolt handle on the side [59]. Due to the lack of production capacities of Great Britain and France, as well as the unwillingness to delay the time of large-scale production of their own weapons, the British and French began to massively purchase Thompson models in 1939. France ordered in November 1939 3750 copies of the year, in March 1940 - another 3 thousand, but the Americans did not have time to deliver weapons, since France had capitulated by that time. From February 1940, the UK began to purchase, and in total, the British acquired 107,500 copies until the end of the war. In December 1940 of the year an order for 20,450 submachine guns also came from the US Army: the production of new models was carried out by Savage Arms[60], since Colt refused to produce, citing the fact that such weapons were more often with gangsters, and not with the military or police[61 ].
