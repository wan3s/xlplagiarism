Now an artificial reservoir has overflowed here (Lake Nasser - بحيرة ناصر), from where the Nile again heads north through a fertile valley 20-50 km wide, which at the beginning of the Anthropogen was a bay of the Mediterranean Sea. As a result of the construction of the Merowe dam in Sudan in 2000- In the 90s, the 4th threshold was flooded [12] [13]. The 900-kilometer section between the rapids and Cairo has a slight slope and is surrounded by a valley up to 20–25 km wide [4]. The growing Nile Delta begins 20 km north of the Egyptian capital Cairo with numerous branches, channels and lakes, which stretches for 260 km along the Mediterranean coast from Alexandria to Port Said. Here the Nile splits into 9 large and noticeably more small branches, the main navigable are Dumyat (Damietta; east) and Rashid (Rosetta ; western), the length of each of them is about 200 km.
