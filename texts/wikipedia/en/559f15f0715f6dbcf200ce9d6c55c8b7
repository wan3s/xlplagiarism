Birds caught in Washington state between June and September had fresh and bright feathers, most likely recently after a molt, but no traces of it were observed [5]. In many other swifts of the subfamily Cypseloidenae, molting begins during the breeding season[9] .Among the three subspecies of the black american swift, the smallest is the nominate subspecies Cypseloides niger niger, found in the West Indies. The largest is Cypseloides niger borealis[5][10], found in North America as far as Alaska and British Columbia. It has a very black plumage with clearly visible white tips on the feathers, the head, especially the forehead, is gray [2].
