To speed up the creation of such an enterprise, it was decided to attract foreign specialists, since the USSR had such experience back in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Already in 1964, the search for possible foreign partners began. The automobile production of the Federal Republic of Germany (Volkswagen) was studied, France (Renault) and Italy (FIAT). Negotiations were held. The final choice fell on the Italian concern FIAT, which was a well-known manufacturer of cars of various classes in Europe and, moreover, was able to produce over 600 thousand cars a year and could design such a giant plant, which was one of the main conditions.
