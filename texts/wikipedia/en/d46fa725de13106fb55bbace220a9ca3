During the second wave, liberal feminism is gaining its popularity. There are more adherents of this trend than in any other feminist direction. This direction has gained development due to the influence of the views of suffragettes fighting for equality of voting rights. Liberal feminism was quiet for four decades after winning the elections. In the 1960s, during the civil rights movement, liberal feminists drew parallels between systemic racial discrimination and gender discrimination[2].
