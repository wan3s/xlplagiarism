At the same time, nests that are more distant from the sea coast are more often built using mosses, ferns and pine needles[20]. Nest building work is usually done early in the morning or late in the evening and takes 13 to 15 days[27], although according to some reports, nest building can be completed in 4 days[20]. Black swifts traditionally set up colonies
in the same places. Scientists attribute this to the fact that so
the necessary conditions for the colony are provided: first
turn protection from predators and the availability of food
resources.
