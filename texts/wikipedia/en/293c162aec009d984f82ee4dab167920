The imitative movements “kus-kanata” (bird wings) and “kos-muyiz” (horns) have become standard positions of Kazakh folk dance[1][2]. Kazakh folk dance is characterized by expressive performance, alternation of fast and measured movements, active work of the shoulders and joints[1]. Women's dances were characterized by a much greater smoothness of movements and an emphasis on the plasticity of the hands[2]. The basis of the performed number is certainly improvisation.
