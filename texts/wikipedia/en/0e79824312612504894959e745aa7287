The black American swift has a strong body and long wide wings, a tail with a shallow but clearly visible cut [2] [4]. The depth of the cut on the tail varies from 4 to 15 mm [5]. behind the fan[6][3]. It is possible that the depth of the incision on the tail and the color of the plumage are related to the age of the bird. In older birds, the notch is usually deeper[5].
