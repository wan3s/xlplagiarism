Autumn migration lasts longer. There are days at the beginning of the migration during which birds are not observed. At the end of the migration, a wave of swifts is possible, apparently associated with storms or adverse weather conditions, such as falling temperatures [8]. Migration from British Columbia also often associated with cyclones [2]. In central and southern California, the migration of black american swifts continues from late August to mid-September.
