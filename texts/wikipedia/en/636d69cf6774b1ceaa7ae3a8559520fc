The radius of the protective action of the lightning rod is determined by its height and is approximately calculated by the formula: R=1.732 xh, where h is the height from the highest point of the house to the peak of the lightning rod. which will ionize the air. With an increase in the power of the source, the range of the lightning rod increases, which can thus be increased to 100 meters or more [3]. Sometimes the lightning rod is built into the decorative elements of a building or structure (weather vanes, column tops, etc.).
