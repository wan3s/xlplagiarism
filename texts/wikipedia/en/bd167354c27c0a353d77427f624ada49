Due to the rapid growth in the number and quality of armored vehicles, as well as the strength of motorized infantry, the Thompson submachine gun has become an indispensable weapon - inconvenient, but effective at short distances. In August 1941, the Americans, having studied the experience of the initial stage of World War II and the Soviet-Finnish war , ordered 319 thousand copies. In February 1942, the 500 thousandth copy was produced, and by the end of the war, there were already from 1.5 to 1.75 million copies of such weapons produced [59] [61]. The production of submachine guns of all models and modifications were carried out under license by the following American enterprises (samples with serial numbers from 1 to 15,040):[62]

Pre-war years (until 1938)
Warner & Swasey Company[en] (Cleveland, Ohio)
Colt's Patent Fire Arms Co. (Hartford, Connecticut)
Birmingham Small Arms Company[en] (Birmingham, West Midlands)
Auto-Ordnance Company[en] (Bridgeport, Connecticut)
War period (from 1938 until the end of production)
Savage Arms Company (Westfield, Massachusetts)
Auto-Ordnance Company (Bridgeport, Connecticut and West Hurley, New York). If the US Army personnel criticized the submachine gun rather for uncomfortable 50-round drum magazines, then the British military did not like even more features of the weapon - too much weight, rumbling sound of a shot and constant jamming when inserting a drum magazine or reloading a weapon.
