Historical outline
                 The species was first described by the German scientist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789[2][32][4] in the 13th edition of The System of Nature. Gmelin named the new species Hirundo nigra and assigned it to the swallows[2][12][33]. The description was based on "Le Martinet de Santa Domingo" from the island of Haiti, included in the work of the French zoologist Mathurin-Jacques Brisson "Ornithologia" (1760)[19][33]. It was not until 1879 that the British colonial administrator Edward Newton, brother of the ornithologist Alfred Newton, was able to get a carcass of a bird in Jamaica [19]. Dr. Caleb Burwell Rowan Kennerley, a surgeon and naturalist who served near Lake Washington in 1857-1859, compiled a detailed description of C. n. borealis, which he considered a new species of Cypselus borealis, and sent it to the American ornithologist Spencer Fullerton Baird.
