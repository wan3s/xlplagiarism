At this time, the birds again formed large flocks, which were about to migrate [8]. Vocalization
Away from their colonies, Black Swifts are usually very quiet[2][8]. Outside of the breeding season, their flocks can remain silent for several hours, and even in early summer, bird calls can be heard extremely rarely. Birds usually give sound signals in pairs [8]. The main call of the black american swift is a short call “chip” or “tip”, which birds often repeat, sometimes switching to a ratchet “tip...tip...tip...trirrirrrrrrrrr...trip... tip...tip", while the squeaky ending of the call "tip...tip...tip...tri-ri-ri-rrrrrrrr-sqeew"[2][4] is possible.
