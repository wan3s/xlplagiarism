Consists of three interconnected parts:
lightning rod - serves to receive a lightning discharge and is located in the zone of possible contact with the lightning channel; depending on the protected object, it can be a metal pin, a network of conductive material or a metal cable stretched over the protected object. grounding conductor or down conductor - a conductor that serves to drain the charge from the lightning rod to the ground electrode; usually it is a wire of a sufficiently large cross section. ground electrode - a conductor or several interconnected conductors that are in contact with the ground; usually it is a metal plate buried in the ground. The elements of the lightning rod are connected to each other and fixed to the supporting structure. next to the object.
