Hydrotropism (from Hydro and Greek tr√≥pos - turn, direction) - the bending of some plant organs under the influence of an uneven distribution of moisture in their environment. For the first time, hydrotropism phenomena were discovered by J. Sachs in 1872 on the roots, which give a deviation towards greater humidity. In In this form, hydrotropism is designated as positive: in roots it is due not to the direct influence of moisture on the growth area, but to the effect on the latter of irritation from the perceived, one-sided distribution of moisture by the root tip. In addition to roots, positive hydrotropism also manifests itself in some other plant objects, for example, in root hairs and pollen tubes.
