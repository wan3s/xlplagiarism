History knows two experimental samples of the "Thompson" under the names "Persuader" (from English - "Enforcer") and "Annihilator" (from English - "Destroyer"). The first was a machine gun with belt feed, which was developed in 1917-1918 and was not assembled, and the second (Ver 10) was distinguished by the absence of a rear sight and a wooden butt. The Annihilator was fed from box magazines [21]. became typical for the Thompsons - with a sight and butt, with the possibility of using box and drum magazines. In total, about 40 copies were produced that did not use drum magazines due to difficulties in shooting.
