Representatives of the subspecies C. n. borealis lay their eggs in southeastern Alaska, in Alberta and British Columbia in Canada, in Washington, Oregon, California, in the mountains of Utah, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and northern New Mexico, sometimes in the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Veracruz .Outside of the breeding season, representatives of this particular subspecies were noted in Saskatchewan and Ontario, as well as in many Mexican states, including the states of Baja California, Durango, Mexico City, San Luis Potosi, Tlaxcala and Zacatecas [11]. In the northern regions of Mexico, birds are practically absent in October-February[2].C. n. costaricensis breeds in Costa Rica, but the birds fly away for the winter[2]. In Costa Rica, the black american swift was usually recorded between April and October[16][2].
