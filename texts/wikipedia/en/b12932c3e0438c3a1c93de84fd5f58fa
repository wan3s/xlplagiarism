 Birds lay their eggs 10-14 days after the completion of the nest, all this time one of the birds remains on the nest, as if it is already incubating eggs[20]. There is usually one egg in the clutch[2][20][27], which is typical for all members of the genus [20]. Eggs are white, elliptical or oval in shape. According to data obtained in Guadeloupe, the size of eggs averages 24.7 × 16.4 mm [2], in California - 28.7 mm × 18, 8 mm with a mass of 5.5 g. The ratio of the mass of eggs to the body mass of an adult bird in the black American swift is 12.5%, which is less than in other representatives of the genus, which also lay one egg each, the white-throated (16.4% ) and spotted-fronted American swifts (16.7%)[20].
