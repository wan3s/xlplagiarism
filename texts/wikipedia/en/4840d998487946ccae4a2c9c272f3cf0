In 1985-1986, a student of Collins, Kevin S. Foerster, made an expedition to southern California for black american swifts, confirmed previously discovered colonies and found several new ones. Foerster explored about 50 different sites, following the criteria, once published by Knorr and added to them one more - the presence of a suitable niche. Referring to the work of Förster, Knorr in 1993 made the appropriate adjustments to his criteria. Förster collected more material than any other previous research on black swifts.
