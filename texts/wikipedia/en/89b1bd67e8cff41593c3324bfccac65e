The canal was completed around 500 BC by King Darius the Great, the Persian conqueror of Egypt. In memory of this event, Darius installed granite steles on the banks of the Nile, including one near Carbet. The fauna of the Nile is quite diverse. There are crocodiles, turtles, very diverse snakes, including two species of cobras, the Nile perch, whose mass can reach 140 kg[3].
