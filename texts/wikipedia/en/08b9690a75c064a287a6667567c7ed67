What is Curdel $$$ Curdel (porta Literatura de cordel) is a genre of poetry popular in the Northeast region of Brazil, which originated orally and was printed on pamphlets for sale on the street [1] hanging on ropes or twine. The name comes from from the Portuguese word “cordel” (“rope”), but today brochures, despite the name and origin, are no longer hung on ropes [2]. In Brazil, the genre is also known under other names: “brochure”, “popular literature in verse” .
