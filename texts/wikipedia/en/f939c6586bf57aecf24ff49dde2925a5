Moss is the main material for building the nest, as well as a small amount of twigs and pine needles, and, if available, ferns and algae[27]. .Building material is highly dependent on how far the nests are from the sea coast. Albert George Vrooman, who first discovered the nest of the black american swift, found eggs in depressions in the mud, while usually nests on the sea coast consist of algae, nests of mosses or algae and mosses are often found.
