The tabloid press came up with many names for the new weapon: "Devil's Death Machine", "Great Helper in Business Prosperity", "Chicago Typewriter" [36] (for the characteristic sound when firing), etc. The mafiosi themselves called it " Tommy-gun. In particular, the following armed attacks using the Thompson are known:

On September 25, 1925, the first Thompson attack was made in Chicago. At the intersection of 63rd Street and West Avenue near the drugstore JJ Weiss, who were driving a sedan car, Frank Macarlane and Joe "Pole" Saltis opened fire on his sworn enemy, Edward "Spike" O'Donnell, the leader of the Chicago O'Donnell gang. O'Donnell miraculously survived, throwing himself to the ground and covering his body with a nearby little boy. Macerlane also tried to shoot his enemy with a gun, but missed.
