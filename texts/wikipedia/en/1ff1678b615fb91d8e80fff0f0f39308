As a result, almost 22.5 thousand employees of the company were fired in 2009, of which: 11.5 thousand took out a pension and 2.3 thousand - early retirement. The crisis affected the quality of products: in October 2009, AvtoVAZ, in the presentation of a business plan, noted that it produces cars of “extremely low” quality, and called itself inefficient on many points.
