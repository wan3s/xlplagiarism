About three thousand years ago, due to the incessant drying up of the climate and the onset of deserts, it ceased to exist. Now only the Wadi Khovar remains of it, in the upper reaches forming part of the border of Chad and Northern Darfur, and then lost in the sands of the Libyan Desert [11]. Below the mouth of the latter a large tributary (Atbara), about 300 km from Khartoum, the Nubian Desert begins. Here the Nile makes a large bend, cutting through a plateau composed of hard sandstones (see Gebel es-Silsila), and crosses a series of rapids (cataracts).
