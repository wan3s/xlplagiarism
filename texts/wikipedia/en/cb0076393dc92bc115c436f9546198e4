The International Union of Ornithologists distinguishes three subspecies[2][32][10]:
Cypseloides niger borealis (KENNERLY, 1858) - in the western part of North America from southeastern Alaska and northwestern British Columbia to the southwestern United States. Presumably winters in South America. Cypseloides niger costaricensis (RIDGWAY, 1910) - in the central part Mexico and Costa Rica. Presumably winters south of the Isthmus of Mexico. Cypseloides niger niger (GMELIN, 1789) - Caribbean islands from Cuba to Trinidad.
