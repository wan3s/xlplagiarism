The ancient Greeks saw the Bosporus and the Caucasus Mountains as the border of Europe. Later, this opinion changed several times for political and economic reasons. During the Migration Period and the Middle Ages, the Bosphorus and the Don River separated two continents. The border was determined by the Swedish officer and geographer Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg, who proposed a border crossing the peaks of the Urals and then down the Emba River to the coast of the Caspian Sea, before passing through the Kumo-Manych depression, which is 300 km north of the Caucasus Mountains. In 1730 this course was approved by the Russian Tsar, and from has since been adopted by many scholars.
