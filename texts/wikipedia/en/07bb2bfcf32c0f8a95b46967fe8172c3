According to Marin and Stiles, the flight of the black american swift resembles the flight of the collared american swift (Streptoprocne zonaris), only its gliding is noticeably faster [3]. In the second half of June, the birds broke into colonies, each with its own daily route, which could reach 50 km (30 miles) in one direction. Rathbun observed in the mornings up to 20 black American swifts, following in one direction one after another at some interval, after which many birds appeared that circled over the area. With the onset of evening, the whole flock gathered together and returned back At the same time, the behavior of swifts did not depend on the weather: similar maneuvers were observed both on windy and calm days.
