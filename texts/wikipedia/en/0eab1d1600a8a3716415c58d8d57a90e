Thureophores (Greek θυρεοφόρος (singular) - "armed with a long shield") - Hellenistic infantry of the III-I centuries BC. e., widespread from the time of the reign of the first Diadochi to the beginning of Roman rule in Greece. The name comes from the name of the shield - thureos (Byzantine form: “fireos”). ).As protection, a bronze or iron Macedonian helmet and a large oval shield - thureos (a wooden shield with a central handle, covered with leather, in the center of which there was a metal umbon and a long metal strip reinforcing the shield) were used. In most cases, the thureophors fought without armor at all , compensating for this with a large shield size, which allowed lower equipment costs, thereby expanding the circle of people who could replenish the army, although in some cases light armor was used (usually linothorax).
